    2PM
    - Implemented Roger Carff's solution for universal Transporter capability, regardless of role
    - Carrying a victim as a non-Transporter role gives a slowness penalty
    - A player cannot use their native role tool while carrying a victim - their tool becomes the occupied stretcher
    - Mod version 1.0.81

MOD:

    4PM
    - Room names mapped to victim locations using new easier room names
    - added Victim Signal Block - registry name --> "asistmod:block_signal_victim"
    - Transporter signaling system works until the FIRST interaction with a victim - either transport or triage, afterwhich the signal system
    no longer tracks the victim
    - missionTimeTraining key added to ModSettings.json giving a separate Mission Time setting for Training and Competency missions
    - "Beep" Messages updated to "Signal" messages to keep the message more generic - mqtt topic also updated along with schema, see MessageSpecs
    - Scoreboard Messages only fire when a victim is successfully triaged and in the appropriate Scoring area.
    - Updated Map - still 2.1 3D
    - Updated MapBlocks.csv file which places signal blocks and maps them to victims via the roomname column

    10PM
    - Mod now filters chat interventions to be only those selected in the trial setup screen of MalmoControl
    - Update to 1.0.80

CLIENTMAP:

    4PM
    - New Image with clearly visible room names A1 A2 A3 ... I4 I5 I6
    - These new names do not supercede the existing room names, they are only used in the signaling system.

    10PM
    - Reverted ClientMapSettings file to show only position of the user instead of global positions
    - Fixed a small parsing bug preventing the above from working correctly

MESSAGE SPECS:

    - Beep Message Model updated to VictimSignal model, with slightly more useful fields including pid and roomname
