# Building

This approach was provided by Adarsh Pyarelal. 

It is included for reference purposes and is not currently officially supported.

To build the mod, run `./gradlew build`

This will produce two files in the `build/libs` folder:
`asistmod-<version>-sources.jar` and `asistmod-<version>.jar`.  Copy those
files over to the Minecraft mods directory. If you are using the free client
with the Malmo distribution, they should go in `Minecraft/run/mods`.
