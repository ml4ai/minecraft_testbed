Victims on this map are now represented as Victim Blocks - a block with a simple face texture. The Syringe item is used to "revive" victims.

The Syringe will be automatically given to any player that joins the map. Revive a victim by breaking the victim block with the syringe. Once a Vicitim Block is broken, it is replaced with a "Safe Block".
